  "schema:description": "__Artist's Statement:__ I always wanted to re-create famous classic painting but with my own touch. This project was perfect for that. So I integrated famous Davis sites in the background of the famous portrait of Mona Lisa. As I walked around DavisI thought what would Mona Lisa visit here in Davis. I immediately thought of the two eggheads. To show where these eggs are from I added the UC Davis water tower in the background. I used acrylic and added the mask to show that Mona Lisa is visiting Davis during a pandemic  \n __Participant age:__ 17  \n __Category:__  Adult Age 15+: Drawing or Painting",
