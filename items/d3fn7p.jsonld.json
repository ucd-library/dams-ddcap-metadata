  "schema:description": "__Artist's Statement:__ My seven year old daughter asked me to draw with her for this project and drew a lonely little girl on the bike path observing social distancing protocols. My drawing was to be paired with hers a representation of her 'alone together' on her way to our vegetable garden. She is in our wheelbarrow being pushed by my wife. I meant it to capture the things we do as a family during this time that are both fun and meaningful but in retrospect we still look lonely  \n __Participant age:__ 43  \n __Category:__  Adult Age 15+: Drawing or Painting",
