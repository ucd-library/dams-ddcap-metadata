  "schema:description": "__Artist's Statement:__ Each week during the pandemic our group goes to the beautiful Arboretum on the UCDavis campus and paints. We are totally socially distanced as the campus is closed and there is plenty of space. I painted this after a recent alert that a black bear Gilligan was loose in Davis. I imagined what his visit my scene would be like so I put him in my painting. This is a watercolor done in the Redwood section of the arboretum.  \n __Participant age:__ 83  \n __Category:__  Adult Age 15+: Drawing or Painting",
