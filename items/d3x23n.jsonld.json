  "schema:description": "__Artist's Statement:__ Mechanical pencil and ballpoint pen on a public domain 1950s map of the Davis area. I love working with maps in portraiture because I believe the area you grew up in or spent a significant time in greatly shapes who you are as a person. Your internal topography is shaped by your community. I used the quadrangles of the map to create windows into the lives of community members. We've all been affected by recent events different ways and cope different ways. I hope to have made that visible.  \n __Participant age:__ 27  \n __Category:__  Adult Age 15+: Drawing or Painting",
