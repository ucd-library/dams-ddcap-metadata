  "schema:description": "__Artist's Statement:__ I tied masks on these statues simply as a whimsical idea--hoping to make people smile. It was never meant as a suggestion to wear masks; in fact I 'asked' the statues on April 3rd three weeks before the masking order was issued by Yolo County. I used a very old and very dirty tablecloth turned rag. The strings were shoelaces--some pulled straight out of my old running shoes. Right after the masking order took effect one mask went missing (I replaced it). I hope nobody ever wore it!  \n __Participant age:__ 54  \n __Category:__  Adult Age 15+: Photography",
