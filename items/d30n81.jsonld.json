  "schema:description": "__Artist's Statement:__ Early during Shelter in Place my neighbor shared her sourdough starter. Bread making (and baking every other thing that can be made with sourdough starter) has been one of my COVID-19 pass times. I doubt that I will be able to keep up with the demands of my edible pet once the world opens back up to it's activities. Having time to create and having common interests with the women on my street has been one of the highlights of this season for me and my family.  \n __Participant age:__ 44  \n __Category:__  Adult Age 15+: Photography",
